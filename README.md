## markovchain.py

This python script contains a class called `MarkovChain` that simulates and plots the trajectories of finite-state Markov chains, as described [here](https://mml.johnmyersmath.com/probabilistic%20programming/2022/12/28/pp1.html). The attributes and methods of the class are described in the docstrings in the script file. Note that the plots output by this class have the generic Matplotlib colors --- the plots that you see in the link above were tweaked by hand to match the color scheme and fonts on my website.
