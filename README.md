# Script and code samples

This repo contains scripts and code samples for the content at my [website](https://mml.johnmyersmath.com).

## bayesian-plots.py

Source code to create the scatter, density, and ridgeline plots in my [post](https://mml.johnmyersmath.com/probabilistic%20programming/2022/12/28/pp1.html) on "Bayesian Fundamentals."

## markovchain.py

Python script containing a class called `MarkovChain` that simulates and plots the trajectories of finite-state Markov chains, as described in my post [here](https://mml.johnmyersmath.com/probabilistic%20programming/2022/12/28/pp1.html) on "Markov Chains". The attributes and methods of the class are described in the docstrings in the script file. Note that the plots output by this class have the generic Matplotlib colors --- the plots that you see in the link above were tweaked by hand to match the color scheme and fonts on my website.
